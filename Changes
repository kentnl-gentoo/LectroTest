LectroTest Change Log
Tom Moertel (tom@moertel.com)

* 0.20_05  Re-release of 0.20_04 to make CPAN happy (2004-09-13)

- I once had a version in Test::LectroTest::Generator but removed it
  because I wanted to version only the entire Test::LectroTest module.
  But CPAN rejected Generator because its version had "fallen."  Crap.
  So, back in goes the version number, now bumped.

* 0.20_04  Documentation improvements, minor code improvements (2004-09-13)

** Fixes

- Some links in documentation were broken.

** Improvements

- Vastly improved docs: All modules now have decent documentation.
  (Tutorial still needs step-by-steps, tho.)

- More pre-flight checks and better error reporting.

- Cleaned up Test::LectroTest's hack for running property checks and
  end of load.


* 0.20_03  Bugfix and doc improvements (2004-09-11)

** Fixes

- !! Important fix: In generator bindings with more than one variable,
  variables sometimes got each others' values.  

** Improvements

- Updated docs.

- LectroTest::Property now pre-flight checks for the use of $tcon in a
  generator binding and emits and error in that case.  ($tcon is used
  for the test controller.)

- TestRunner will now catch and report exceptions thrown during
  property checks:

  - A thrown exception results in test failure.

  - The "details" report will include a "Caught exception" section,
    if needed.

  - TestRunner::results now has an exception field:
    - undef if no exception was thrown during testing
    - the exception otherwise
