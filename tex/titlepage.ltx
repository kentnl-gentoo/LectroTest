\abstract{\noindent This document describes LectroTest for Perl, which
takes the form of the Test::LectroTest family of Perl modules.
LectroTest is an automated, specification-based testing
system.  Rather than forcing you to specify individual
test cases, LectroTest generates them automatically
according to property definitions that you provide.
Each property definition represents a specification of your
software's expected behavior.  LectroTest tests this
behavior by running your software in thousands of random test
cases.  When your software's actual behavior can be
shown to deviate from the specifications, LectroTest
will emit a ``counterexample'' to show where the
deviation occurred.  Counterexamples can be used to
debug your software, and they also make great
regression tests.}
