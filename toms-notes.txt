** Statistical testing

Tell story about how a statistical randomg testing turned up a problem
in Int.  You ran 100,000-value trials in each of several tests.  Three
of the tests involved generating integers from ranges of negative
numbers, e.g., [-300,-100].  You expected the mean of the distribution
to be the exact center (-200) but it was in fact slightly larger
(about 201), a fact you didn't detect until you had raised the sample
size from 10,000 to 100,000.  Only then did you have sufficient
samples to conclude that the difference of just 1 was significant.
Inspection of the code revealed the problem:

    my $span = $rhi - $rlo + 1;
    return Gen {
        return int($rlo + rand($span));
    };

Note that int(X) always rounds X toward 0.  But for our purposes
we must always round toward -Infinity.  Therefore, when X is
negative and fractional, we round in the wrong direction.  So,
when we thought we were generating random integers in the
range [-300,-100] we were really using the range [-299,-99].
The fix is to replace int(X) with floor(X) or ensure that
X is always non-negative:

    my $span = $rhi - $rlo + 1;
    return Gen {
        return $rlo + int(rand($span));
    };

** Errors caught

- $length should have been (defined $length) in String builder
  - caught by test suite
