=head1 NAME 

Test::LectroTest::Compat - Use LectroTest property checks in a Test::Simple world

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use MyModule;  # contains code we want to test
    use Test::More tests => 2;
    use Test::LectroTest::Compat;

    # property specs can now use Test::Builder-based
    # tests such as Test::More's cmp_ok()

    my $prop_nonnegative = Property {
        ##[ x <- Int, y <- Int ]##
        cmp_ok(MyModule::my_function( $x, $y ), '>=', 0);
    }, name => "my_function output is non-negative" ;

    # and we can now check whether properties hold
    # as a Test::Builder-style test that integrates
    # with other T::B tests

    holds( $prop_nonnegative );   # test whether prop holds
    cmp_ok( 0, '<', 1, "trivial 0<1 test" );  # a "normal" test

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module lets you use mix LectroTest property checking with other
popular Test::* modules.  With it, you can use C<ok()>-style checks
from Test::* modules within your LectroTest property specifications
and you can check LectroTest properties as part of a Test::Simple or
Test::More test plan.  (You can actually take advantage of any
module based on Test::Builder, not just Test::Simple and Test::More.)

The module exports a single function C<holds> which is described
below.

=head2 holds(I<property>, I<opts>...)

    holds( $prop_nonnegative );  # check prop_nonnegative

    holds( $prop_nonnegative, trials => 100 );

    holds(
        Property {
            ##[ x <- Int ]##
            my_function2($x) < 0;
        }, name => "my_function2 is non-positive"
    );

Checks whether the given property holds.

When called, this method creates a new
Test::LectroTest::TestRunner, asks the TestRunner to check the
property, and then reports the result to Test::Builder, which in
turn reports to you as part of a typical Test::Simple- or
Test::More-style test plan.  Any options you provide to C<holds> after
the property will be passed to the C<TestRunner> so you can change the
number of trials to run and so on.  (See the docs for C<new> in
L<Test::LectroTest::TestRunner> for the complete list of
options.)

=head1 BUGS

In order to integrate with the L<Test::Builder> testing harness (whose
underlying testing model is somewhat incompatible with the needs of
random trial-based testing) this module redefines two Test::Builder
functions (C<ok()> and C<diag()>) for the duration of each property
check.

L<Test::LectroTest::Property> explains in detail what
you can put inside of your property specifications.

L<Test::LectroTest::Generator> describes the many generators and
generator combinators that you can use to define the test or
condition space that you want LectroTest to search for bugs.

L<Test::LectroTest::TestRunner> describes the objects that check your
properties and tells you how to turn their control knobs.  You'll want
to look here if you're interested in customizing the testing
procedure.

L<Test::Simple> and L<Test::More> explain how to do simple
case-based testing in Perl.

L<Test::Builder> is the test harness upon which this module
is built.
